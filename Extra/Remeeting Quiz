Question 1:

144 is your favorite number. I started looking at the elements present in the web page, and also
looking at network request being sent, but since there was nothing in there, I realized it would be
better to write a script that performs get requests for every number between 100 and 1000
(exclusive). The following code in written in Python 3.

    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup


    def find_fav_num():
        uid = "remeeting"
        pwd = "quiz"
        endpoint_url = "https://remeeting.com/quiz/python_script.cgi?number="

        for i in range(100, 1000):
            page_content = requests.get(endpoint_url+str(i), auth=(uid, pwd)).content
            soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser')
            if 'Sorry' not in soup.text:
                print(i)
                break



Question 2:

The following code in written in Python 3.

    def improved_function(data):
        if not data:
            return 0
        n = len(data)
        s = sum(data)
        ss = sum([x*x for x in data])

        return ss/n - (s*s)/(n*n)


Question 3:

*Random* here is just an integer between 0 and 9 chosen randomly in every iteration. The following code in written in Python 3.

    def process():
        count = 1
        for line in sys.stdin:
            rndom_num = random.randint(0,9)
            sys.stdout.write(str(rndom_num))
            if count == 10:
                sys.stderr.write(line)
                count = 0
            count += 1


Question 4:

I worked on building an Internet Relay Chatroom app written in JavaScript using Node.js and Sockets.io
based on a client-server networking model. The project is hosted at - https://irc-chatroom.herokuapp.com/ .
Users can either start or join a chat room and communicate with other users present in that room. I
am proud of this project because when I was in my undergrad, I was really overwhelmed by my
Computer Networks course. This project helped me overcome my fear of socket programming and helped
me achieve a higher comfort level.


Question 5:

I would like to be asked what I learnt from this quiz?
